Xin Gao received the B.S. degree from the Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2021, where he is a Ph.D. candidate in mechanical engineering from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China. His research interests include Decision-making for CAVs, , ethical decision-making, graph reinforcement learning. He has published over 10 papers at leading conferences and journals such as TITS, IOTJ, ITSC, IV etc. He is a member of the Chinese Society of Automotive Engineering. He is also a research assistant in Peking University (PKU Alignment and Interaction Research Lab). He also serves as a reviewer for IOTJ, EAAI, BSPC, ITSC2023, and IV2024.

Research interest
======
1. Mixed Traffic: I am interested in the prediction and decision-making behaviors of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic environments. My focus areas include graph topological structures and deep reinforcement learning.
2. Ethical Decision-Making: I am interested in the decision-making behaviors of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) when faced with ethical dilemmas. This includes end-to-end decision-making processes and ethically aligned decision-making frameworks.
